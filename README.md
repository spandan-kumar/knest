## Deployment

### Coolify (Self-Hosted)

1. **In Coolify Dashboard:**
   - Click "New Resource" ‚Üí "Application"
   - Select "GitHub" as source
   - Choose your `knest` repository
   - Set branch to `main`

2. **Configure Build Settings:**
   - Build Pack: `Dockerfile`
   - Dockerfile Path: `./Dockerfile`
   - Port: `3000`
   - Health Check Path: `/api/health`

3. **Configure Persistent Storage:**
   - Add a volume mount for the SQLite database:
     - Source: `/app/prisma` (or any host path)
     - Destination: `/app/prisma`
   - This ensures your database persists across deployments

4. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   # Required
   AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here  # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com  # Or http://your-ip:port
   DATABASE_URL=file:./prisma/knest.db
   ENCRYPTION_SECRET=your-encryption-secret  # Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32

   # Optional
   NODE_ENV=production
   NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
   ```

5. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy" to start the build process
   - The Dockerfile will automatically run database migrations on startup
   - Monitor logs for any issues

### Migrating from JSON to Database

If you have an existing deployment with JSON-based user storage:

1. **Backup your data:**
   ```bash
   cp data/users.json data/users.json.backup
   ```

2. **Run the migration script:**
   ```bash
   bun run scripts/migrate-users.ts
   ```

3. **Verify migration:**
   - Check the database: `bun x prisma studio`
   - Ensure all users were migrated successfully

### Other Platforms

This app can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker:

- **Railway**: Easy deployment with persistent volumes
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Docker container support
- **AWS ECS/Fargate**: Container orchestration
- **Google Cloud Run**: Serverless containers (note: use Cloud SQL for production)
- **Fly.io**: Docker deployment with persistent volumes

**Note**: For Vercel deployment, you'll need to use a different database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) as Vercel's serverless environment doesn't support persistent SQLite files.

### Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Yes | Secret for NextAuth session encryption |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Yes | Your application URL (with protocol) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | SQLite connection string |
| `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` | Yes | 32-byte hex string for encrypting API keys |
| `NODE_ENV` | No | Set to `production` in production |
| `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` | No | Disable Next.js telemetry |

## Security

### API Key Storage
- User API keys are encrypted using AES-256-GCM before storage
- Encryption key must be 32 bytes (64 hex characters)
- Never commit `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` to version control

### Database Security
- SQLite database is file-based and stored in `/app/prisma/knest.db`
- Ensure proper file permissions in production
- Use volume mounts to persist data across container restarts
- Regular backups recommended

### Authentication
- NextAuth v5 with JWT strategy
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- Session tokens expire after inactivity

## Database Management

### Prisma Studio (GUI)
```bash
bun x prisma studio
```
Opens a web interface at `http://localhost:5555` to view and edit data.

### Creating Migrations
```bash
bun x prisma migrate dev --name migration_name
```

### Applying Migrations in Production
```bash
bun x prisma migrate deploy
```
This runs automatically in the Docker container on startup.

### Resetting Database (Development Only)
```bash
bun x prisma migrate reset
```
**Warning**: This deletes all data!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Gemini API key not configured"**
- Ensure you've added your API key in Settings page after logging in
- The key must be valid and have proper permissions from Google AI Studio

**"Invalid Gemini API key"**
- Verify the key at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- Ensure the key has access to Gemini 2.5 Pro model

**"File size exceeds 50MB limit"**
- Compress your audio file or use a shorter recording
- Consider using a lower quality audio format

**"Unsupported audio format"**
- Convert your audio file to one of the supported formats (WAV, MP3, M4A, WebM, OGG)
- Use online converters if needed

**"Failed to access microphone"**
- Check browser permissions for microphone access
- Ensure you're using HTTPS in production (required for microphone access)

**"Database locked" error**
- SQLite doesn't handle high concurrency well
- For high-traffic deployments, consider migrating to PostgreSQL or MySQL
- Check that the database file isn't being accessed by multiple processes

**"Prisma Client not generated"**
- Run `bun x prisma generate` to generate the Prisma Client
- In Docker, this happens automatically during build

### Design Patterns
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separated into service classes
- **Custom Hooks**: React state management and side effects
- **Presentational Components**: UI components receive data via props
- **API Route Handlers**: RESTful API endpoints with Zod validation
- **Repository Pattern**: Database access through Prisma ORM
